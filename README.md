How can you support:
 - I need a Macintosh to test Deepcopy, so if you have an unused and can give that to me, that would be a help.

INSTALL:
 - important python3 modules (Ubuntu package names)
   - python3-pil  (manual install: 'pip install pillow')
 
 - for development:
   - mypy         (pip install mypy)
   - coverage     (pip install coverage)

TODO: 
 - test with different image sources (grayscale, predefined color palette, with alpha channels...)
