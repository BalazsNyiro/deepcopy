How can you support:
 - I need a Macintosh to test Deepcopy, so if you have an unused and can give that to me, that would be a help.

# INSTALL support
deepcopy_installed_correctly.py -> check available modules and print install hints.

# INSTALL
 - important python3 modules
   - python3-pil  
     - apt install python3-pil    (install with apt package manager)
     - pip install pillow         (install with pip)
   - multiprocessing (works on Linux/win)
   - multiprocess   (only Mac)    (pip install multiprocess)  pip install multiprocess
 
# INSTALL for development

Tools:
   - mypy         (pip install mypy)
   - coverage     (pip install coverage)

To validate with mypy: validate_mypy.sh
To validate coverage:  validate_coverage.sh
